### 🌐 **Deployment Options for FastAPI**

FastAPI works with **all the same deployment platforms**:

1. **Railway** - Excellent FastAPI support
2. **Render** - Native FastAPI deployment
3. **Fly.io** - Great for FastAPI apps
4. **Vercel** - Better FastAPI support than Flask
5. **Heroku** - Full FastAPI compatibility

### 📊 **Should You Switch?**

**For your pricing calculator, I'd recommend FastAPI because:**

✅ **Better file handling** - Your Excel uploads will be faster
✅ **Automatic docs** - Team can see `/docs` endpoint
✅ **Modern framework** - Future-proof choice
✅ **Same deployment** - Works on all platforms we discussed
✅ **Easy migration** - Your Flask logic can be ported over

### 🎯 **My Recommendation**

**Stick with Flask for now** if you want to deploy quickly, **OR** **migrate to FastAPI** if you have a few hours to improve the app significantly.

**Quick FastAPI deployment steps:**
1. Convert your Flask routes to FastAPI
2. Update `requirements.txt` (add `fastapi uvicorn`)
3. Deploy to Railway/Render with FastAPI
4. Share the URL with your team
